## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#as the rmse value for with caffeine is actually lower, i want to test if its due to random error
#or if it was providing useful predictive information not captured

#i will conduct a two sample t test to compare the two values to see the significance of the Caffeine
#i tried many ways but none of them worked due to lack of data so i'm going to generate more

#no matter how much data I generate I still only get one rmse value, meaning that there isn't enough variability in the data to come a conclusion on whether or not caffeine happens to influence the linear regression or it's just due to chance 
#Here is some not deleted code I tried for a few hours to create both a two sample t-test and one sample t-test; comparing one to the other to solve for the p-value(comparing the models with caffeine and without) before googling what consistently returning one root mean squared error means.
